These tests were conducted on a deliberately slanted plates.  The 0.5-inch plates were placed with the starting edge 0.1" below the torch tip and the stop edge 0.4" below the torch tip, so the standoff should vary linearly as the cut progresses.  The three tests were conducted at different speeds: Test1 at 18ipm, Test2 at 14ipm and Test3 at 10ipm.  The gas flow rates were set to 26scfh total and 0.71f/o ratio.
