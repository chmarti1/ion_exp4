# Experiment 4

In experiment 4, a current signal sine wave was imposed between the torch and work piece while piercing and cutting.  The voltage was measured, and the ratio of the two signal amplitudes (at the frequency of excitation) was interpreted as the regime 2 resistance.  This experiment scrutinized the effects that impacted that resistance throughout the cutting operation.

The `METHODS` file is the step-by-step procedure for data collection that was observed by laboratory personnel.

The experiment and its results is described in detail in the [2020 Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science paper](./docs/2020_etfs.pdf) [1] included in the `docs` directory.

For a description of all tests performed, see [docs/summary.md](./docs/summary.md).

For a detailed description of the raw data format, see [docs/data.md](./docs/data.md).

For a description of the post processing scripts and their resulting outputs, see [docs/export.md](./docs/export.md).
